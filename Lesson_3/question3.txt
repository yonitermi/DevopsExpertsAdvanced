1. Write a YAML file that defined a secret named “db-creds” representing database
    connection. A database connection is composed of the following:
    a. Username - root_user
    b. Password - Experts!123
    c. Database URL - mysql.services.com
2. Write a YAML file that deploys an NGINX pod that mounts those secrets under
    /usr/share/nginx/html in the NGINX container.
3. BONUS: Split the NGINX pod to be constructed from 3 different pods, each one of them
    mounts a specific secret from the secret and expose those pods with ingress as follows:
    a. mysql.services.com/username
    b. mysql.services.com/password
    c. mysql.services.com/url
