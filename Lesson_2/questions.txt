1. Write a YAML file that deploys the following:
a. two applications that is routed via ingress controller
b. the application is about cheese store.
c. the application address is: https://ams.cheese.com
d. the application will have two deployments:
i. cheddar
ii. gauda
e. setup an ingress controller that will route the following:
i. https://ams.cheese.com/cedder -> will go to the cheddar deployment
ii. https://ams.cheese.com/gauda -> will go to the gauda deployment
2. Mount as config map the attached file to an nginx container under the path
/usr/share/nginx/html
3.
4. BONUS: write your images that will return images of those cheeses and use them in
your YAML files.






This YAML file deploys:

1. Two deployments: cheddar and gouda, with placeholder images (your-cheddar-image and your-gouda-image). 
   You can replace them with the actual image names.
2. A ConfigMap named nginx-config, which mounts an index.html file to the /usr/share/nginx/html path in the Nginx container.
3. An Ingress named cheese-ingress that routes the paths /cheddar and /gouda under the host ams.cheese.com to the respective deployments.
4. Two Services, cheddar and gouda, which expose the deployments internally.


To deploy this YAML file, use the appropriate Kubernetes command, such as kubectl apply -f lesson_2.
Remember to replace the placeholder images with the actual image names for the cheese deployments.
